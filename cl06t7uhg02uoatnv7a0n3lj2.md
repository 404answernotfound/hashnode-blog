## Best OS for Front End Devs? Easy. Not.

## Which OS should I use?

Let's be real, it's not 1990 and the possibilities for web programming are so wide that one could
probably state, loud and clear, that **any** operating system (_OS from here on_) is a good choice.

Why is it a good choice tho? Why would you have the same quality of coding and productivity both with a **Windows OS**, a **MacOS** or
the long time favorite, **Unix OS** based systems?

The short answer can be recapped from the intro, just a little bit above this paragraph: _it's not 1990 anymore_.

Systems have evolved, _Windows now pretty much ships with Linux installations out-of-the-box_, and I'm not talking about virtualized, heavy, non-performing Unix installations, I'm talking about containerized full scale Unix OS, smooth as water.

So how do we know what **system is better for front end engineering**, but also for software engineering as a whole? Pretty simple, we look at the tools we are used to use.

Some tools are **Unix OS only**, which means that you cannot run them directly on Windows (unless you use Linux inside of Windows), but that also means that you can probably use them on MacOS **because MacOS is Unix-based** and that, among many other reasons, is why a lot of software engineers do love their Macbooks Pros.

Now, _am I telling you to go out there and buy a 3.000,00$ Macbook_?

If you can spend that money, sure, I'm a macOS user and I do love my Macbook Pro, so **I do recommend that system**. Also, if you want to work on macOS or iOS, there's no other way, you have to have a macOS computer.

At the same time, **you probably won't need it** (but it can make your dev life easier for the tooling you can install on it) and why won't you need it? **Because you got to be real and recognize the tools that you are using**.

Most of you readers _might only be using_ VSCode with extensions and for that any system is a good OS for software engineers.

As a Front End Engineer what's your toolbelt like?

1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. Javascript
4. Frameworks (React, Angular, Vue et al)
5. NodeJS (even if just for configs and npm)
6. **Browsers**

See where I'm getting at? Those tools are available **EVERYWHERE**, on **EVERY** system.

So again, I'll recap like this:

_use whichever system you can buy and that makes you more productive. Whichever answer to those parameters is the right choice_.

## What to buy

There are so many good choices out there, but depending on your preferences I'd argue my top three would be:

1. Macbook Pro 14" (2021)
2. Lenovo XPS 13" (Both Windows and Linux)
3. Alienware (if you are also a gamer)
