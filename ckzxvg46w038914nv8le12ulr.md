## Don't let fear take away the fun. An Impostor Syndrome rant from 2022

## Impostor Syndrome

_**Programming has been one of the best choices of my life**_.
That's how I ended the last post before all the salutations and whatnot.
Know why I did that? Because I firmly believe in what I wrote, of course. _Why else_.

Today we're going to briefly talk about something that's been bothering me so much since I first came to 
know it had a name. I always felt it, somehow, you know, that weird little feeling of mental agony that whistles
inside your head and hums the dumbest words ever:  

> "_you can't do it, you are too stupid, **you will fail**_"

Today we are here to say **fuck that**. Yeah, that's it. Fuck that.

Impostor Syndrome is not only a programmer's or a techy's thing, and it pretty much lies everywhere there are things
to be learnt, changes in life to be made, choices in life to be taken.

Impostor Syndrome is that little vengeful enemy that you have been carrying around since you were a child. It was born from you.
_How_, you ask? Pretty simple.

It could have been anything. Your first low grade at school, your not-so-much-friends from when you were younger, picking on you.
It could have been your parents attitude, a teacher's, a classmate, anyone really. Anything really.

Does that make all the people around us the shittiest people ever? No, it doesn't.

So why am I telling you this? Also fairly simple once you get the hang of it:

> **It doesn't matter**

You spent years being your worst enemy, years avoiding confrontation with yourself, _fearing your own judgement_. But why? Aren't you
the person who is supposed to love you the most? _Spoiler alert_: you are.

We don't know each other but let me tell you this. **You gotta be good to yourself and respect yourself**.

I'm writing this blog to an audience of probable Software Engineers or people in the tech field, so I'll be specific.
If it takes you more hours than other people to study a library, a language, a framework, it doesn't matter and it doesn't mean anything.
Take your time, hone your skills, go where you want to see yourself in the time you need.

**There are no rules, this is not a game but you can have fun as if it was. That's the beauty of it.**

People have been in this field for decades and even the top scientists feel like newbies from time to time.

_**Accept that you don't know and you will have the power to know everything**_.

That's it, that's my rant for you. Feel good? I hope so. Feel weird? Why. Feel bad about yourself? Never, give yourself a hug!
