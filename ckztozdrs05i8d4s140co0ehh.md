## Building a blog to share your #100daysofcode

## Introduction

Hello everyone, my name is Lorenzo and I'm just starting my **hashnode adventure**.

I decided to start with this post because it seemed fitting of the role a first-timer's post should have (_well, at least in my mind!_).

But putting aside very long paragraphs, **I'd like to thank you all** first and foremost, because if you are reading this you are probably participating or very interested in the #100daysofcode challenge and that, my friends, make **you a really amazing bunch**! _Hurray_!

So I thought I'd do the same and follow up on my talking by not being just on [
üê¶ Twitter](https://twitter.com/404answnotfound) but also _sharing my path to learning new technologies and how I feel about the tech world_.

Before diving into this discussion, I would like list a few places where you can find me:

- [My personal blog](https://404answernotfound.eu/), **404answernotfound.eu**
- [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzopieri/), where I'm always open for DMs
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/404answnotfound), which I already linked!

## What is #100daysofcode

As the name implies, [#100daysofcode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) is a coding challenge open to everyone, whenever and wherever you are in the world üó∫

Having no boundaries whatsoever, it makes it possible for people of any background to either get started in the tech community or grow even more if they are already a part of it!

Don't get it wrong tho, it's not all about those 100 days but they are definitely useful to build up momentum and pick up new skills along the way.

Pretty much like in the movie "The Fight Club" there are only two rules one must abide to, and those would be:

> - Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
> - Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.

The idea is as simple as it is powerful! You, **the amazing person you are**, are committing to do something everyday for the next 100 days and you are **doing that something not for somebody else, but for your very self and for your own wonderful growth**.

## What to build for #100daysofcode challenge

There's no precise answer to that so I'd go with the _whatever seems fun to you and makes you **happy**_ but I get it, if you are a beginner it can definitely look intimidating to start something from scratch without the faintest idea of what to do and where to go from there.

(I guess that might also be why you are reading this article  ü§ó, but don't worry, I've got your back!)

There are oh so many websites and articles, just like [this one](https://404answernotfound.eu/blog/javascript-projects-for-beginners-age-9-to-99) ‚òùÔ∏è, entertaining new comers with hundreds of projects ideas but If I may, I should probably come out and say it out loud:

I was once taught - ‚Äú_Everyone has good ideas, not many of them get built!_ üòå‚Äù

So my 50 cents on this subject is that you should probably scout the Internet for beginners' projects but you should also allow yourself to not get overwhelmed by the amount of information that you are going to discover.

**Take it slow, _one step at a time_**.

It's a marathon, not a sprint.

Remember that you are human, remember that you are worth it and you can do it.

Now that we hopefully believe in ourselves let's get a few ideas out in the wild:

1. Your own personal website
2. A website for your local community
3. A script to automate whatever makes you bored
4. Use visual representations for simple ideas (make a game for a simple javascript counter! [Use your imagination!](https://github.com/GiacomoBorsellino/Countercat))
5. Stop watching Youtube tutorials and get your hands dirty with coding!

## Goodbye
